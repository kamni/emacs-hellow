# Emacs Hello World Example

This is a basic example for writing a package for Emacs. It was written as
part of a personal learning project and is intended for someone just getting
started in Emacs (which applies to me at the time of writing this).

Some work with lisp-based languages is assumed.

## Roadmap

### 0.6.0

* Using a popup window
* Using the same buffer as the main buffer
* Utilities for managing the popup window:
  * hide
  * quit
  * clear

### 0.7.0

* Defining a minor mode
  * Minor mode always on for buffers
* Keybindings for minor mode
* Suggestions for config file to turn minor mode on

### 0.8.0

* Can we use a macro to generate the functions?
